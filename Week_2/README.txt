= Week 1 Homework

* http://uwruby.com/

== DESCRIPTION:

Student Name: XXX
Homework Week: 2

This week you will be playing with the evils of eval.  You will also hopefully
be playing with using the different *_eval methods in block form.  Unfortunately
it is very difficult for me to force you to use one eval method over the other,
so please try to mix it up if you can!

Also, don't forget about define_method!

The test names should give you hints about how to solve the problem.
